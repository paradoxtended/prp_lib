## prp_lib
A FiveM library and resource implementing reusable modules, methods, and UI elements.

## ! IMPORTANT !
Keep in mind, that this resource is "fork" from [ox_lib](https://github.com/overextended/ox_lib) resource from Overextended.

We have just edited some lines in interface/client and highly changed style of the library.

So everything you see in this resource is basically Overextended's code, we copied it here so we could easilly manipulate with "our" library for FiveM.
## Installation
- Download the latest version
- Copy and paste the "prp_lib" folder to your resources folder
- Make sure you have installed [ox_lib](https://github.com/overextended/ox_lib)
- Ensure prp_lib after ox_lib
